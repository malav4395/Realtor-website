            <p>Selling a home can be complicated. There’s lots to do, from preparing
              the property for sale, to marketing the listing, to the negotiations and
              paperwork. If you’re ready to embark on the home selling process, or just
              get a head start on planning, take your first step with this Home
              Selling article. <br><br>
              This is a resource to help you navigate through the home
              selling experience, from <b>“listed”</b> to <b>“sold.”</b><br><br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Seller Dos and Donts</h2>
            <h3 class="section-heading"><b>DO</b></h3>
            <p><b>Clear Out & Clean Up</b><br>
              You want house-hunters to imagine your house as
              their own, so clear out the clutter. Remove excess
              home décor, pack up the collectibles, put away the
              kids’ toys, and eliminate pet evidence. You’ll also
              want to clean everything, from the baseboards to the
              ceilings and every spot in between. In addition, keep
              the house at a comfortable room temperature.<br><br>
              <b>Update & Upkeep</b><br>
              Impress house-hunters with simple yet visually
              appealing updates. Inside, consider swapping out old
              light fixtures, painting dark walls lighter, and replacing
              dingy carpets. Outside, keep up with your yard work:
              trim bushes and trees, keep the grass cut or the
              driveway shoveled, and plant flowers or add greenery
              for a flattering first impression.<br><br>
              <b>Organize & Categorize</b><br>
              Everything has a place. Arrange furnishings to
              complement the size, traffic flow and natural light of
              the room. If you’re not sure, consult a professional
              stager. You’ll also want to organize all of your
              paperwork: inspection reports, property disclosures,
              appliance manuals, etc. Then, categorize them in an
              easy-to-access binder for quick reference.<br><br>
              <b>Respect & Respond</b><br>
              You may be partial to your home, but not everyone
              will be. Respect professionals’ (appraiser, inspector,
              stager, etc.) opinions on what changes can be made
              to make your home appeal to more people. Don’t be
              offended by a low offer; respond to the buyer and
              let them know the offer was too low but that you are
              serious about accepting a better one.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading"><b>DON'T</b></h3>
            <p><b>Fall Behind</b><br>
              Selling your house is hard work. Don’t slack, stay
              up-to-date on your responsibilities. Keep your home
              clean and the yard well-maintained throughout the
              process. Once you find a buyer, don’t fall behind on
              bills; keep paying your mortgage and utility bills on
              time so you don’t have extra costs to cover at closing.<br><br>
              <b>Get Ahead</b><br>
              It takes time to sell a house in today’s market.
              Don’t try to get ahead of the trend and enter into
              negotiations with buyers who aren’t pre-approved
              for a mortgage. Don’t price your home excessively,
              listen to your agent and price it according to market
              conditionss. Pricing it too high can keep it on the
              market and make it appear unattractive, flawed or
              stale.<br><br>
              <b>Hide or Hover</b><br>
              Your house needs to be available, you do not. Don’t
              make your house unavailable for showings by
              requesting a day’s notice or not answering the phone
              or email. Your home needs to be ready when buyers
              are. Don’t hover around during showings. Buyers like
              their space and may feel awkward or uncomfortable
              sharing their thoughts with you present.<br><br>
              <b>Do it All or Leave it All</b><br>
              Working with a real estate agent can be invaluable.
              Why try to do it all when you can hire a professional
              agent with the experience and expertise to do it for
              you? However, when you hire a real estate agent,
              don’t leave it all up to them. You’ll have a number
              of personal responsibilities to manage to help make
              your home selling experience successful.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading"><b>CLEAN UP THE CLUTTER</b></h3>
            <p>
              If you are listing your house and getting it ready for
              showings, clean up the clutter. A good way to start
              is to go through everything you don’t use on a daily
              basis and create three piles: pack it, donate it, and
              junk it.<br><br>
              <b>Pack It</b><br>
              For the items you’re packing, go online and search
              “portable storage and moving containers.” These
              convenient containers can be rented monthly and
              take the trip out of the traditional storage unit. They
              are delivered to your house, you pack it up, and
              they’re picked up and stored for you until you’re
              ready to add more – or unload it at your new house!<br><br>
              <b>Donate It</b><br>
              For the items you’re donating, a number of charities
              now offer scheduled donation pick-ups. Visit your
              favorite charity’s website to learn when they’ll be in
              your neighbourhood. <br><br>
              <b>Junk It</b><br>
              For the items you’re dumping, first make sure
              they can be dumped. Certain items need to be
              recycled or properly disposed of. Check with
              your municipality website to find a convenient
              and affordable way to properly dispose of certain
              materials. If what you have truly can be junked,
              consider renting a dumpster for large quantities.<br><br>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="images\Home-seller-glossary.png" width="100%" alt="Home-seller-glossary" />
            <h2 class="section-heading">Home Seller’s Glossary</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Asking Price:</b> The price that the seller has
              agreed to list their property for. The asking price
              is different from the selling price, which is the
              final price that has been agreed upon by the
              buyer and seller<br> <br>

              2. <b>Balanced Market:</b> In a balanced market, there is an
              equal balance of buyers and sellers in the market,
              which means reasonable offers are often accepted
              by sellers, and homes sell within a reasonable
              amount of time and prices remain stable.<br><br>

              3. <b>Bridge Financing:</b> A short-term loan designed
              to “bridge” the gap for homebuyers who have
              purchased their new home before selling their
              existing home. This type of financing is common
              in a seller’s market, allowing homebuyers to
              purchase without having to sell first.<br><br>

              4. <b>Buyer’s Market:</b> In a buyer’s market, there are more
              homes on the market than there are buyers, giving
              the limited number of buyers more choice and
              greater negotiating power. Homes may stay on the
              market longer, and prices can be stable or dropping.<br><br>

              5. <b>Closing:</b> This is the last step of the real estate
              transaction, once all the offer conditions outlined
              in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale have been
              met and ownership of the property is transferred
              to the buyer. Once the closing period has passed,
              the keys are exchanged on the closing date
              outlined in the offer.<br><br>

              6. <b>Chattels:</b> Unattached items in the home that
              can be removed without doing any damage
              to the property, such as curtains, but not the
              curtain rods since they are physically attached
              to the home. Chattels are usually not included
              with the home purchase, unless specified in the
              Agreement of Purchase and Sale.<br><br>

              7. <b>Conditional Offer:</b> When the sale of the home
              hinges on predetermined conditions, such as
              “conditional on financing” or “conditional on a
              satisfactory home inspection.” If the conditions
              are not met, the buyer can back out of the deal.<br><br>

              8. <b> Counteroffer:</b> When the original offer to
              purchase a home is rejected by the seller, the
              seller can counteroffer with adjustments, usually
              to the price or terms of the purchase, such as the
              closing date<br><br>

              9. <b>Curb Appeal:</b> The appeal of a home when
              viewed from the curb. Curb appeal includes the
              home’s exterior, front yard, and anything else
              that’s visible from the street.<br><br>

              10. <b> Current Market Assessment:</b> A CMA (Current
              Market Assessment) is provided by your real
              estate agent during the listing process and
              is complimentary. This report assists with
              determining the asking price of the home, using
              current housing market information such as supply
              and demand, seasonality, home information like
              location, age, square footage and more.<br><br>

              11. <b> Fixtures:</b> Items that are physically attached to
              the home and require tools to remove. Fixtures
              are included as part of the purchase. Examples of
              fixtures include ceiling lights, cabinet hardware and
              appliances. If the seller plans to take any fixtures
              with them when they move, either remove them
              prior to listing the home, or be sure to specify the
              fixtures in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.<br><br>

              12. <b>FSBO:</b> Acronym for “For Sale By Owner,”
              meaning the seller hasn’t retained the services
              of a real estate agent or broker to assist with the
              sale of their home. By virtue of the FSBO, the
              seller will avoid paying the real estate agent’s
              commission fee, which is split between the listing
              and buying agent.<br><br>

              13. <b>Home Value Estimator:</b> A home value estimator
              is a tool, typically found online, that helps home
              sellers estimate the value of their property. The
              result is an estimate and different from a detailed
              property assessment provided by a Realtor. <br><br>

              14. <b>List-To-Sale-Price Ratio:</b> The difference between
              the listing price of a home and the final selling price,
              expressed as a percentage. If the list-to-sale-price
              ratio is more than 100%, the home sold over asking.
              If it is below 100%, the home sold under asking<br><br>

              15. <b>MLS:</b> The Multiple Listing Service, commonly
              referred to as MLS, is a real estate selling system
              operated jointly by real estate Boards and
              Associations across Canada<br><br>

              16. <b>Offer:</b> An offer is a legal agreement to purchase
              a home. An offer can be conditional on a number
              of factors, commonly conditional on financing
              and a home inspection. If the conditions are not
              met, the buyer can cancel their offer..<br><br>

              17. <b>Porting:</b> Transferring your mortgage (and
              the existing interest rate and terms) from one
              property to another.<br><br>

              18. <b> Seller’s Market::</b> In a seller’s market, there are
              more buyers than there are homes for sale. With
              fewer homes on the market and more buyers,
              homes sell quickly in a seller’s market. Prices of
              homes are likely to increase, and there are more
              likely to be multiple offers on a home. Multiple
              offers give the seller negotiating power, and
              conditional offers may be rejected.<br><br>

              19. <b>Staging:</b> Preparing a home for sale to
              appeal to a wide range of homebuyers. The
              staging process often includes decluttering,
              depersonalizing, deep-cleaning, and minor
              updates such as painting and rearranging
              furniture.<br><br>

              20. <b> Virtual Deals:</b> The home-buying process
              completed by means of technology in place of
              face-to-face contact. Some common technology
              tools include 360 home tours and video
              showings, video conference calls, e-documents,
              e-signatures and e-transfers.<br><br>
