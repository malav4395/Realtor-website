            <p>You’ve heard it before: buying a home may be the largest purchase you
              will ever make. Does that make you nervous? Consider this: it can also be
              one of the best investments you will ever make.<br><br>
              From the pride you feel by being a homeowner to the tax deductions
              associated with home ownership, the benefits are plenty. If you’re ready
              to travel the road toward home ownership, take your first step with me. This article is a resource to help familiarize
              you with the home-buying process, and present you with relevant
              information, including a list of terms, things to consider when choosing
              a home, and a checklist to help you make the right decisions for you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">10 STEPS TO PURCHASING A HOME</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 2;">
              1. Choose a real estate agent that's right for you. <br>
              2. Know your budget. <br>
              3. Explore mortgage options, get pre-approved. <br>
              4. Create a remax.ca account and browse homes online. <br>
              5. Identify homes you like and schedule home tours. <br>
              6. Make an offer. <br>
              7. Get a home inspection. <br>
              8. Close the deal. <br>
              9. Update utilities and transfer services. <br>
              10. Move into your new home! <br>
            </p>
            <p>Whether you are moving across town or across
              the country the real estate market is a big place,
              and an experienced RE/MAX Agent can help you
              navigate it. RE/MAX Agents have access to current
              market information and can help you make informed
              decisions about the areas and properties that
              interest you. As you move through the process, your
              RE/MAX Agent can walk you through confusing
              paperwork and, of course, assist you in house
              hunting</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Homebuyer's Glossary</h2>
            <p>By familiarizing yourself with these home-buying basics, you’ll be better
              equipped to make informed decisions and a wise investment. </p>
            <p>1. <b>Amortization:</b> The length of time allotted to
              paying off a loan – in home-buying terms, the
              mortgage. Most maximum amortization periods
              in Canada are 25 years.<br> <br>

              2. <b>Balanced Market:</b> In a balanced market, there is an
              equal balance of buyers and sellers in the market,
              which means reasonable offers are often accepted
              by sellers, and homes sell within a reasonable
              amount of time and prices remain stable.<br><br>

              3. <b>Bridge Financing:</b> A short-term loan designed
              to “bridge” the gap for homebuyers who have
              purchased their new home before selling their
              existing home. This type of financing is common
              in a seller’s market, allowing homebuyers to
              purchase without having to sell first.<br><br>

              4. <b>Buyer’s Market:</b> In a buyer’s market, there are more
              homes on the market than there are buyers, giving
              the limited number of buyers more choice and
              greater negotiating power. Homes may stay on the
              market longer, and prices can be stable or dropping.<br><br>

              5. <b>Closing:</b> This is the last step of the real estate
              transaction, once all the offer conditions outlined
              in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale have been
              met and ownership of the property is transferred
              to the buyer. Once the closing period has passed,
              the keys are exchanged on the closing date
              outlined in the offer.<br><br>

              6. <b>Closing Costs:</b> The costs associated with
              “closing” the purchase deal. These costs can
              include legal and administrative fees related to
              the home purchase. Closing costs are additional
              to the purchase price of the home</p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="images\closing_cost.jpg" width="100%" alt="closing-cost"/><br><br>
            <p>
              7. <b>Comparative Market Analysis:</b> Comparative
              market analysis (CMA) is a report on comparable
              homes in the area that is used to derive an
              accurate value for the home in question.<br><br>

              8. <b>Home Inspection:</b> The home inspection is
              performed to identify any existing or potential
              underlying problems in a home. This not only
              protects the buyer from risk, but also gives the
              buyer leverage when negotiating a reduced
              selling price.<br><br>

              9. <b>Condominium Ownership:</b> A form of ownership
              whereby you own your unit and have an
              interest in common elements such as the lobby,
              elevators, halls, parking garage and building
              exterior. The condominium association is
              responsible for maintenance of building and
              common elements, and collects a monthly
              condo fee from each owner, based on their
              proportionate share of the building.<br><br>

              10. <b>Contingencies:</b> This term refers to conditions
              that have to be met in order for the purchase of
              a home to be finalized. For example, there may
              be contingencies that the mortgage loan must
              be approved or the appraised value must be
              near the final sale price.<br><br>

              11. <b>Deposit:</b> An up-front payment made by the
              buyer to the seller at the time the offer is
              accepted. The deposit shows the seller that the
              buyer is serious about the purchase. This amount
              will be held in trust by the agent or lawyer until
              the deal closes, at which point it is applied to the
              purchase price.<br><br>

              12. <b>Down Payment:</b> The down payment is the
              amount of money paid-up front for a home,
              in order to secure a mortgage. In Canada, the
              minimum down payment is 5% of the home’s
              total purchase price. Down payments less
              than 20% of a home’s purchase price require
              mortgage loan insurance. The selling price,
              minus the deposit and down payment, is the
              amount of the mortgage loan.<br><br>

              13. <b>Dual Agency:</b> Dual agency is when one agent
              represents both sides, rather than having both a
              buyer’s agent and a listing agent.<br><br>

              14. <b>Equity:</b> The difference between a home’s market
              value and the amount owing on the mortgage.
              This is the portion of the home that has been
              paid for and is officially “owned.”<br><br>

              15. <b>Fixed-Rate Mortgage:</b> A fixed-rate mortgage
              guarantees your interest rate and for a predetermined amount of time, typically 5 years.
              When the term expires, you have the option
              to stay with the same lender or switch to a
              different one.<br><br>

              16. <b>Land Transfer Tax:</b> This is the tax payable by
              the buyer to the province and/or municipality
              in which the transaction occurred upon
              transferring land. The amount varies depending
              on the region, the size of the land and other
              factors.<br><br>

              17. <b>High-Ratio Mortgage:</b> A high-ratio mortgage
              is a mortgage where the borrower has less
              than 20% of the home’s purchase price to make
              as the down payment. A high-ratio mortgage
              with a down payment between 5% and 19%
              of the purchase price requires mortgage loan
              insurance. In Canada, 5% is the minimum amount
              required for the down payment.<br><br>

              18. <b>Home Appraisal:</b> A qualified professional
              provides a market value assessment of a home
              based on several factors such as property size,
              location, age of the home, etc. This is used to
              satisfy mortgage requirements, giving mortgage
              financing companies confirmation of the
              mortgaged property’s value.<br><br>

              19. <b>Home Buyers’ Amount:</b> This is a $5,000 non-refundable federal income tax credit on a
              qualifying home, providing up to $750 in tax
              relief to assist first-time buyers with purchase related costs.<br><br>

              20. <b>Home Buyers’ Plan:</b> A federal program allowing
              first-time homebuyers to withdraw up to
              $35,000 interest-free from their Registered
              Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to help
              purchase or build a qualifying home. The
              borrowed amount must be repaid within 15 years
              to avoid paying a penalty.<br><br>

              21. <b>Land Survey:</b> A land survey will identify the
              property lines. This is not required to purchase
              a home, but it is recommended and may be
              required by the mortgage lender to clarify where
              on the property the owner has jurisdiction. This
              is important if issues arise between neighbours
              or the municipality, should the owner wish to
              make changes in the future such as installing
              a pool, fence or other renovations involving
              property lines.<br><br>

              22. <b>Freehold Ownership</b>: A form of ownership
              whereby you own the property and assume
              responsibility for everything inside and outside
              the home.<br><br>

              23. <b>Porting:</b> Transferring your mortgage (and
              the existing interest rate and terms) from one
              property to another.<br><br>

              24. <b>Seller’s Market:</b> In a seller’s market, there are
              more buyers than there are homes for sale. With
              fewer homes on the market and more buyers,
              homes sell quickly in a seller’s market. Prices of
              homes are likely to increase, and there are more
              likely to be multiple offers on a home. Multiple
              offers give the seller negotiating power, and
              conditional offers may be rejected.<br><br>

              25. <b>Virtual Deals:</b> The home-buying process
              completed by means of technology in place
              of face-to-face contact. Some common digital
              tools include 360 home tours and video
              showings, video conference calls, e-documents,
              e-signatures and e-transfers.
